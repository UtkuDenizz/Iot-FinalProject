Project Overview

The Smart Home System aims to provide users with an easy way to monitor and control their home environment using connected devices. The system can include lights, temperature sensors, security cameras, and smart plugs.

The goal is to increase comfort, energy efficiency, and security through automation and remote access via a mobile or web interface.

2. Stakeholders

Homeowner (Primary User): Wants to control and monitor home devices easily.

System Administrator: Manages the system configuration and updates.

Guest Users: Have limited control (e.g., turning lights on/off).

3. Use Cases
Use Case ID	Title	Description	Actor	Precondition	Outcome
UC1	Turn on/off lights	The user can turn lights on or off via the app	Homeowner	Device connected	Light status updated
UC2	Adjust temperature	User changes thermostat setting remotely	Homeowner	Sensor connected	Room temperature adjusts
UC3	Security alert	System notifies user of unusual movement	System	Sensors active	Notification sent to user
UC4	Energy monitoring	User checks daily energy consumption	Homeowner	Devices recording data	Report displayed
4. User Stories

As a homeowner, I want to turn my lights on and off remotely, so I can make it look like someone is home when Iâ€™m away.

As a user, I want to see the current temperature and adjust it, so my house stays comfortable.

As a user, I want to receive alerts when motion is detected, so I can respond to possible intrusions.

As an admin, I want to add and remove devices, so I can maintain the system easily.

5. Non-Functional Requirements

Usability: Simple, intuitive interface.

Security: Encrypted communication between devices and the server.

Scalability: Support for adding more devices in the future.

Reliability: System should operate even if one device fails.

6. Future Enhancements

Voice control integration (e.g., Alexa, Google Home).

Machine learning-based automation (e.g., predicting user behavior).

Energy-saving suggestions.

7. Tools and Technologies

Backend: Python (Flask / FastAPI)

Frontend: React.js / HTML-CSS

Database: SQLite or Firebase

Hardware (optional): ESP32, Raspberry Pi, or Arduino
